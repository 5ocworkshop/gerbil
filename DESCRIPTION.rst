Gerbil -- A GRBL interface
==========================

Gerbil aims to be a good, fast, reliable and reusable pure Python3 module which interfaces with all features of the modern GRBL CNC firmware (versions 0.9 and newer) with heavy emphasis on asynchronous events and callbacks which allows embedding it in other CNC applications, either GUI or command-line based.

Gerbil is the name of a cute rodent. The name was chosen because of the similarity with GRBL. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerbil
